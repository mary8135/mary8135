In order to change the cursor when hovering the SVG image, a <style/> tag was added within the <svg/> file itself. Example:

<svg width="x" height="y">
	...
<style>
	svg {cursor: pointer; }
</style>
</svg>

This will also make sure that the cursor will show when hovering the "background" of the svg, not just the individual letters and shapes.
This is however not working for custom url cursors.
