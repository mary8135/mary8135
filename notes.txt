To change the cursor when hovering the SVG image, a <style/> tag was added within the .svg file itself. Example:

<svg ...>
<style>
	svg {cursor: url("cursor1.cur"), pointer; }
</style>
</svg>

This will also ensure that the cursor will show when hovering the "background" of the svg, not just the individual letters and shapes.

Note: In order for it to work, a fallback cursor ('pointer' in the above example) must be defined as well.
